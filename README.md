# Eternal Garage Company

The idea is to create a fictional vintage repair workshop company that wants to showcase and convey their services to potential clients through a static website.

You can view the website here [https://neiqo.github.io/Eternal-Garage/](https://neiqo.github.io/Eternal-Garage/)
