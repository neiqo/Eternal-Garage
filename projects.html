              The blue 1964 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint Speciale, restored by
              Eternal Garage, is a classic car icon. Designed by Franco
              Scaglione of Bertone, it was a race-ready version of the
              Giulietta, powered by a sophisticated Alfa Romeo DOHC inline
              4-cylinder engine. Its design drew inspiration from the sleek
              Carrozzeria Touring “Disco Volante” racing cars and Bertone’s
              futuristic Berlina Aerodinamica Technica (BAT) experimental show
              cars.<br /><br />

              Eternal Garage’s restoration project preserved these unique
              features while enhancing performance and comfort. The team
              restored the car’s bodywork and overhauled the original engine,
              ensuring it runs as smoothly and powerfully as it did in 1964.
              <br /><br />

              The interior was restored to its original glory, with premium
              leather seats and meticulously refinished dashboard and trim
              details. The result is a beautifully restored blue 1964 Alfa Romeo
              Giulia Sprint Speciale that offers a driving experience that
              rivals contemporary models.

              Eternal Garage undertook the restoration of a black 1973 Land
              Rover Series 3, a vehicle renowned for its durability and off-road
              prowess. The exterior was meticulously restored, preserving the
              iconic silhouette and original black paint. Any signs of wear were
              repaired, resulting in a vehicle that mirrors its original 1973
              condition.<br /><br />

              Under the hood, the original engine was overhauled. Each component
              was checked and restored or replaced as necessary, ensuring the
              vehicle runs as smoothly and reliably as it did in its prime.<br /><br />

              The interior was also restored, with seats reupholstered in
              premium leather and the dashboard and trim details refinished. The
              result is a comfortable interior that stays true to the vehicle’s
              utilitarian roots. The final product is a beautifully restored
              black 1973 Land Rover Series 3, ready to take on any terrain just
              like it did decades ago.

              The team embarked on a restoration project of a 1972 Porsche 911,
              a car renowned for its performance and design. This particular
              model, with its pale yellow paint job, is a testament to the
              vibrant style of the 70s.<br /><br />

              The exterior restoration preserved the car’s iconic silhouette and
              the unique pale yellow paint, enhancing its vintage charm. The
              original 2.4-litre flat-six engine, known for its power and
              reliability, was meticulously overhauled. Each component was
              checked and restored or replaced as necessary, ensuring the car
              runs as smoothly and powerfully as it did in its prime.<br /><br />

              Inside, the team restored the car’s interior, reupholstering the
              seats in premium leather and refinishing the dashboard and trim
              details. The result is a beautifully restored 1972 Porsche 911
              that not only pays homage to its rich history but also offers a
              driving experience that rivals contemporary models. This project
              stands as a testament to the team’s passion for classic cars and
              their commitment to preserving their beauty and performance for
              future generations to appreciate.
